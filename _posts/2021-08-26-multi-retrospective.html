title: A retrospective on Multi
category: blog

<p>Perhaps my favorite phase of any project is when I get to call it done.
<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi">Multi</a> has come a long way since <a href="/blog/multi">its initial announcement</a>.
It was neat to have built a tool that (1) had become part of my daily workflow and (2) had so many interesting opportunities for extension.
Neither of those points are true for me today, so I decided to <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi/commit/14f2d1b5524a8477f203d8e1cb4b6100ea35a5f2">make Multi free</a> for new users.</p>

<h2 id="selling">Selling</h2>

<p>Multi earned around $1500.
In total, that’s a pretty impressive number to me: coming out to ~$100/month.
The catch is that only 1/3 of those earnings came from sales.
The rest came from an API extension I made to support another developer’s use case–contract work, essentially.
I don’t have issues with contract work generally, but I don’t have capacity for any right now.
Deducting that one-off, Multi maybe sells one or two licenses in a normal month, and that’s not enough to offset the support effort.
I always suspected Multi would sell a bit more if I put in any amount of effort towards marketing, but I never gathered the enthusiasm for that.

<h2 id="not-proficient-and-not-excited">Not proficient and not excited</h2>

<p>For the most part, I’ve been able to resolve user issues as they come up.
There are a couple bugs though that I can’t figure out.
I’ve spent several hours looking into these issues, and ultimately those sessions leave me intimately aware of my unfamiliarity with macOS development.
Reflecting on those experiences, I realized that I need at least one of the following conditions in order to stay motivated:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am in a professional setting: “I am being paid to solve this bug.”</li>
  <li>I am aiming for proficiency: “This bug is something I need to understand.”</li>
  <li>I am genuinely interested in the problem space: “What a fun bug!”</li>
</ol>

<p>The previous section explains how Multi doesn’t fall under motivation #1.
Since I no longer use Multi myself and am not aiming for proficiency in AppKit, Multi work has never fit into #2 and has gradually slipped out of #3.
Thinking through that list helped me realize that I’m ready to move on to other projects.</p>

<p><em>Edit: Migrating Multi to SwiftUI helped the project better align with motivations #2 and #3; hence <a href="/blog/multi-3">Multi 3.0</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Multi 2.1.4 is the first version that removes the license key checks.
I will continue supporting Multi 2.1.3 installations until their license keys expire.
I also plan to clean up the GitHub issues to make the project more amenable to outside contributions.
If Multi stirs any of your core motivations, I hope you <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi">stop by</a>!</p>
