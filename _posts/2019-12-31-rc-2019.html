title: My time at the Recurse Center
category: blog

---

<p>I recently finished a 12-week batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=65e59108b8d145fc3abc19ac684004a8">Recurse Center</a>.
I’m still finding it a bit tricky to succinctly describe <em>what</em> RC is.
Here’s how I put it in my personal newsletter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anything can happen, and that excites [me].
The Recurse Center imposes no structure on attendees’ time, which adds even more possibilities to what each week will bring.
Most weeks, [I’m working] on something new, like making the bathroom icon dance or making Bitmoji dance or making 3D spheres dance…
come to think of it, much of [my] work has been dance-adjacent.
That’s the kind of place RC is though.
Programmers from different “sub-specialties” spend time working on something both a little new and a little familiar.
It’s a playground. And it’s fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the rest of this post, I’ll summarize each of my projects,
why I chose it, and what I accomplished.</p>

<h2 id="game-of-life-animated-svg-source">Game of Life animated SVG (<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/rc/blob/master/src/Cgol.elm">source</a>)</h2>

<p>Coming into RC, my goal was to learn the fundamentals of animated graphics on the web.
I started by animating SVGs with plain old Elm, ignoring CSS’s timing primitives.
On the second day of RC, someone typically organizes a pairing workshop,
where participants code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.
I decided to stick with this problem for the rest of the week,
and turned my attention to making it look as smooth as possible.</p>

<h2 id="flossing-character-animated-svg-source">Flossing character animated SVG (<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/rc/blob/master/src/Floss.elm">source</a>)</h2>

<p>Armed with the power of smooth animations and bored with Conway’s so-called “game”,
I turned to a more entertaining domain: dance!
This first dancer uses normal SVG paths, redrawn on each browser animation frame.
We can simulate the arms moving “front-to-back” by switching the order in which we
draw each body part, depending on where we are in the dance loop.</p>

<h2 id="dancing-bitmoji-source--talk">Dancing Bitmoji (<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/rc/blob/master/src/Warp.elm">source</a> / <a href="/talk/bitmoji-webgl-elm">talk</a>)</h2>

<p>Animating the bathroom icon is fun, but I figured it might be more rewarding
to animate something in my own likeness.
Bitmoji’s API is rather closed—there is no means to “decompose” a Bitmoji’s limbs or visual features.
It’s just a raster image, which limits the animation options.
As I was discussing this limitation, another Recurser introduced me to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIYxyQ2s64c&amp;t=140">Puppet Warping</a>,
a Photoshop technique for displacing points in an image around pinned anchors.
Using WebGL, we can apply a similar technique to distort Bitmoji’s PNGs
according to user-defined anchors.</p>

<h2 id="airtable-proxy-api-source">Airtable proxy API (<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/airtable-app-proxy">source</a>)</h2>

<p>At this point, I’m about halfway through my time at RC.
I wanted to take a short break from graphics,
so I started some utility apps that I’ve wanted to exist for some time.
The first: a proxy for Airtable’s API that allows you to define “row-level permissions”.
I based the idea on <a href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> and <a href="https://hasura.io">Hasura</a>,
which both provide means for exposing your database more directly to your web clients.
A tool like this would speed up the initial prototype phase of new applications,
making it easier to use Airtable as my interim database.
I planned to use a predefined column (i.e. “Owner”) on all tables to keep track of which rows were visible by which users.
Then this middleware application would check the JWT <code>sub</code> on each request and deny any unauthorized attempts.
After a few days, I scrapped this project since Airtable’s API rate limits made my approach unfeasible.</p>

<h2 id="find-tweets-source">Find Tweets (<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/find-tweets">source</a>)</h2>

<p>My second non-graphics detour was a collaboration with another Recurser and attempt to learn
<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>.
We both ran into this problem: we like, retweet, or DM a meme.
But when we want to share it with someone else days later, it takes forever to find.
The app is a super-simple keyword search across those three channels.
The workflow leaves <em>much</em> to be desired (and it doesn’t always… find the tweets),
but it was a breeze to get up and running with Svelte.
Most of our time unfortunately was spent learning Oauth 1.0 to authenticate with Twitter’s API.</p>

<h2 id="live-midi-dancer-source">Live MIDI dancer (<a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/rc/blob/master/src/Visualizer.elm">source</a>)</h2>

<p>For my final RC project, I returned to dance for inspiration.
All of my dance experiments thus far ignored one major dimension of real dance: the music.
In this project, I used the WebMIDI API to listen to notes from my hardware synth.
These notes trigger moves defined with a custom DSL using a live-coding editor.
Of course, this whole thing is easier to demonstrate with a video:</p>

<p>This is the only project, I plan to pursue further now that my batch is over.
