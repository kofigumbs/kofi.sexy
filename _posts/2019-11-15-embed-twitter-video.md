Last night, I spent some time exploring Twitter's documentation for embedding tweets.
I needed to embed a tweet with an attached video, play the video programmatically,
and detect when the video finishes.
Twitter has no such API to observe playback stateâ€¦ but HTML5 video does!
Here is my workaround, which hopefully saves you some time:

- Load [Twitter's embed widget](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/javascript-api/guides/scripting-factory-functions) using the tweet's ID
- On a server (AWS Lambda in my case) use the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/get-statuses-show-id) to lookup the tweet's metadata
- Grab the `.mp4` video URLs from the JSON response
- Replace the tweet widget's media content with a `<video>` tag referencing the `.mp4` URL
