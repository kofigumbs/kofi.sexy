<p>Over the last several months,
I’ve been riding the emotional roller coaster that is finding a summer internship.
For me this process was filled with ups, downs, and emails—a ton of emails.
Over and over again, I found myself having to use the word “résumé,”
but I refused to settle for the lazy spelling that ignores the diacritics.
My work-around involved an elaborate 4-step process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google “resume”</li>
  <li>copy the correct spelling from the Wikipedia entry</li>
  <li>paste it into my email</li>
  <li>change the ‘R’ to an ‘r’</li>
</ul>

<p>As a software developer, I saw this as a problem and sought a solution.
Thus, my Chrome extension, Resume, was born!</p>

<hr />

<p>Despite my embellished story-telling,
there is absolutely nothing earth-shattering about this idea or application.
However, I think it was worth developing, and my justification follows.</p>

<h3 id="trivial-needs-are-still-needs">Trivial needs are still needs</h3>

<p>Last semester I needed to memorize Bible verses as part of a study I attended.
I wanted to set text as my phone’s background,
but the notepad apps I had didn’t export images or provide clean screenshots.
Of course, I could have written in Keep or Evernote
then cropped what I didn’t want out of the picture, but why should I?
Just because what I want may seem trivial,
doesn’t make me a second class citizen…
and 200+ active installs tell me that others feel similarly.</p>

<p>Who knew about Dong Nguyen 6 months ago?
(Probably the same number of people that know him by name now.)
I think when Dong released Flappy Bird,
he was releasing a product that he enjoyed creating.
I don’t think he had a premonition that he would earn $50k per day,
and I don’t think he planned on rising to the top of App Store overnight.
Dong wasn’t revolutionizing anything, and worst case scenario:
he would have built a game that didn’t catch.
But since it did catch, he saw huge reward.</p>

<p>Similarly, Just Write and Resume aren’t meant to disrupt the market or change the world.
This means that I don’t have to worry about achieving perfection the first time around.
I am free to continue to iterate and improve at my own pace.
Publishing trivial apps is a great way to gain exposure to different technologies
while leaving the door open for unexpected possibilities.</p>

<h3 id="anything-can-be-designed-well">Anything can be designed well</h3>

<p>As a computer science student, I learn a whole lot about programming,
but not all of it is relevant to software development.
I can’t use my knowledge of NP-completeness in every project,
but everything has a design aspect, whether that be fonts or scroll animations.</p>

<p>In every project, developers can and should choose to design well
because design affects people, and people are valuable.
The 200+ users of Just Write represent 200+ opportunities
for me to make life a tad more convenient for an actual person.
Computer science eduction can’t offer that perspective.</p>

<p>In short, if I only have trivial ideas, then so be it —
I’ll design them well, release them into the wild, and then hope for the best!</p>
